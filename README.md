# UP/DOWN Counter + Seven Segment Display
This is a counter, which counts from 0 to 2^18, both up and down. Designed to be implemented on a DE2-115, and this uses the onboard Seven Seg. Display. So it contains the design for both a binary to BCD converter which uses dibble-dabble algorithm to convert, and a BCD to seven segment converter, which just looks up the number corresponding and sets the register to display it correctly.
